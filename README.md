<b>PROJECT TITLE:</b> CRYPHYTONOLOGY: An Integration of Python Programming in Message Encryption and Decryption <br><br>
<b>PROJECT OVERVIEW:</b><br>
  This project is an extensive and interactive program that allows the user to simulate message encryption and decryption through various cryptographic methods included in the program. These cryptographic methods include the following: shift cipher, affine cipher, vigenère cipher, and the RSA cryptography. In each simulation, the program not only demonstrates the encryption and decryption processes but also describes the algorithm behind these processes. Also, the program also attempts to assess the understanding and knowledge of the users in basic cryptography by implementing a ‘Question & Answer’ component consisting of numerous questionnaires. <br><br>
<b>FEATURES:</b><br>
1. Establihses a user-friendly interface <br>
2. Offers multiple cryptographic methods and simulations <br>
3. Includes the algorithmic description and processes of each cryptographic method <br>
4. Provides knowledge assessment questionnaires <br>
